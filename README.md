## Node Installed

Make sure that you have node installed on your system. You can
run `node -v` in your terminal, currently, I am running Node 5.10.0

```
node -v
v5.10.0
```

## Setup package.json

In your project root, run `npm init` to create a package.json file in the
root of your Rails project. The command will walk you through the creating
